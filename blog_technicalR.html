                    Initially I was under the impression that I would have to rebuild my website as a React App but then I learnt that you could still implement 
                    React components onto an HTML website. I did try to follow the React documentation and example on how to add a React component, but I couldn’t 
                    seem to get it to work. I still wanted to have a prototype on the website to give you some idea of what it would look like or at least how I 
                    want it to function. The only problem is I don’t know how to use React to make that component and add it to the HTML website. I am only going 
                    to assume for now that the best way to fix this would be to build the entire website in React and use it like that. I really hoped that that 
                    wouldn’t be the case because I did try to rebuild the website in React and I was going nowhere fast with it. Hopefully between now and the 
                    exam I can either learn how to properly implement React components into my already existing website or figure out how to build it in a React App. 
                    So, as it currently stands, there is no React currently implemented on my site.

                    A big problem that I encountered during this problem was the prototype for my art portion. I’m struggling with thinking about how to use React 
                    to make it. I think largely it comes down to me not spending enough time with React and not knowing or having a better understanding of how it 
                    works and what I can do with it. I’m not sure if the prototype itself should be a component or if I should be making each part of the game a 
                    separate component and then putting them together and that then also becomes something that confuses me because I’m not entirely sure how to 
                    do that or if a component can be edited and changed once it’s exported to the App file. Largely it’s pointing towards me needing to spend more 
                    time with React both in terms of my website and just practicing more. 
                </p>

                    Another thing that I’m struggling with is designing the responsiveness of the website in terms of how it would look on smaller devices. I’m 
                    not sure how to approach it in a way that doesn’t compromise the idea and the intention of the website as it is now. In my head, the website 
                    and the artwork do, in some ways function as a whole and I’m concerned that I won’t be able to do the responsiveness in a way that doesn’t 
                    lose that intention and that meaning. I think it will have to be a case of trial and error and looking how to translate some of the aspects 
                    of the website so that it still reads the same.

                    For this assignment I was planning on making use of an interesting React library called React95 where the elements are styled like that of 
                    Windows95. I was struggling a lot with trying to translate what I already have into React or at least into the react structure and I think 
                    figuring it out was taking more time than what I had left so I’m going to try and implement it for the exam. I think this library, and another 
                    similar one that I found would really help in terms of adding to that vaporwave aesthetic and making it seem more cohesive and recognisable. 
                    A big challenge I think is going to be reworking what I have into a React format and I probably would have been able to for this one had I 
                    managed my time better or started earlier on it. I think the changes to the visuals of the website for now are almost at where I want it, 
                    but I do definitely want to push it a little more and kind of capture that feeling of what most people associate with vaporwave.

                    A note to keep in mind is that while trying to implement the scaling feature to the windows that the blogs are in, it does register that the 
                    window can be scaled but when you try to it works as a drag function. I think for the exam, I should try and isolate the drag function to the 
                    title bar div instead of the entire window div. 
                </p>
            </br>
                <p>
                    I also need to find a way to keep the page size fixed so that adding new elements or icons on the page won’t trigger the scrolling function 
                    of the page. This will help to stop breaking the immersion of being on a “desktop”.
