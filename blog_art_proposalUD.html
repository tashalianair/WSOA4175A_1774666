                <h1>Internet Artwork: Update</h1>
            </br>
            <p>
                My idea for my piece of internet art has largely stayed the same. I still want to look at intrusive thoughts and things like imposter syndrome 
                and in some way reflect what being a creative who has spent the better part of two years, largely or almost entirely online. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I do want to try and incorporate more themes and connections between cyberfeminism and also some of the points that Donna Haraway discusses 
                in the Cyborg Manifesto and some of her other essays written around the topic. This will require me to do a lot more research on the topic 
                and also a lot of planning and drafting the ways in which something like this can be implemented and structured.
            </p>
            <p>
                Based on the feedback that I received I do want to work towards incorporating the themes of cyberfeminism and the Cyborg Manifesto into my 
                artwork because I feel like the two bare a close relation and that that is something that should be explored further. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Initially I wanted it to look like a file application or something to that effect, but I want to change it slightly. I’m considering styling 
                and formatting the game to look more like a text-based game like Undertale or something to that affect. I do want the player to be aware that 
                they are playing a game and make it feel gamic and ‘fun’ experience while also communicating something of a universal experience that many 
                people have right now. For this iteration I just wanted to test the functionality of being able to choose options and trying to see how I want 
                the text and the options to be presented. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I do want the game to feel cyclical in the sense that it feels like a loop to the player. I think this will help to enforce the feeling I’m 
                trying to portray of being stuck and feeling trapped within these feelings and this mindset.
