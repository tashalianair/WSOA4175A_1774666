                <h1>üåø<i>The Female Extension</i> by Cornelia Sollfrank (1997)üåø</h1>
                <p>
                    Background information (taken from: <a href="https://artwarez.org/femext/content/femextEN.html">here</a>)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sollfrank used the Female Extension to participate in the Galerie der Gegenwart of the Hamburger Kunsthalle‚Äôs net art competition, the name of which was Extension (because it was meant to be a new extension to the museum).
                </p>
                <p>
                    She notes that a problem with the competition was that there was a lack of understanding around concepts of the internet and World Wide Web and definitions around net art and art on the internet and that traditionally trained people in the art communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                   <i>‚ÄúIn the case of EXTENSION, it was planned to upload the projects of the artists into the server of the art museum. What would remain of works based on communication, exchange and interaction with the user and are in a permanent process of change, or with works linked to other sites? In addition to that, the call for contributions implied that the internet and the World Wide Web were the same, and limited net art to web art. What was left out were works that use other protocols such as e-mail, muds and moos, as well as context systems such as The Thing and t0-netbase.‚Äù </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sollfrank simulated over 200 international, female net artists, their names assigned to different nations, all seemingly real artists and all of them registered to compete in the contest. She then proceeded to produce net art for all of the contests that she created ‚Äúusing a computer program that collected HTML-material with search engines on the World Wide Web and recombined this data automatically, the net art projects were generated.‚Äù
                    The large number of women who entered (because of Sollfrank‚Äôs piece) was congratulated and celebrated in the news and the media and by the museum itself. But dispute the effort that Sollfrank took to take the theme of the competition (‚ÄúInternet as material and object‚Äù) not a single of the over 200 artists she registered won. The three money-prize winners were men, dispute two-thirds of the registered contestants being women.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sollfrank states that she also considers Female Extension to be an example of cyberfeminism. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Sollfrank‚Äôs artwork as both an example of cyberfeminism and in terms of internet art makes interesting points. At the time Sollfrank created this piece the concept of net art or art on the internet were starting to gain a lot of traction and popularity and those who had created the contest were not experts on the matter. The concept of the artwork, whether created by traditional or digital means was approached from the perspective of what the museum would feature and what they would associate with being an artwork. Sollfrank‚Äôs exquisite corpse-esque creations approached the idea of what net art should be viewed as or how else it could be created, utilising the World Wide Web and the Internet in the most literal sense to create her works. By compiling snippets of web pages to create something new. 
                    It was said that the reason behind Sollfrank taking this approach was because she was working within the realm of the theme which was ‚ÄòInternet as material and object‚Äô. The way in which she created her pieces seems to take this theme quite literally, using the internet as both the canvas to host the work as well as the thing that the works were made of.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>The Female Extension</i> as a whole and in the way that Sollfrank created and presented it turns the artwork around and shows how it functions within the realm of feminism and technology and the way that people who are not men are treated within spaces of technology and the arts. Two-thirds of the entries were women, a large number of those were Sollfrank‚Äôs entries, and yet somehow not a single one of them was chosen to be one of three winners. Sollfrank‚Äôs piece functions as two, the first being the presented piece, the exquisite corpse-esque creations that utilise the internet and its contents as a means of creating art, and the second being the creation of the simulation of artists who entered and the rejection of their works. This could be viewed as a starting point for discussions around the way that people who are, as Cheong et al. (2021) explain, ‚Äú<i>minoritised</i>, rather than a <i>minority</i>,‚Äù because ‚Äúthose represented are not necessarily in the minority more widely speaking, but rather are effectively kept in the minority for a wide range of reasons, usually by the dominant group,‚Äù. The discussion could be centred around the fact that people who are considered minorities within technological or digital fields are kept there by those who are considered the majority, in most cases, cis-gendered heterosexual white men.
