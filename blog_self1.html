                In terms of the technical portion of the assignment, I would like to think that at the very least I’ve met most of the minimum requirements. I think I could definitely improve the metadata tags that I have and make them more effective, and I definitely need to look at ways in which to improve the responsiveness of the website and look at the ways in which I could preserve the look and feel of the website while also making it responsive and accessible. The javascript that I have has been used in both small and big things. I used it for the clock and date in the navigation bar and used javascript to make the blog window’s draggable 
            </p>
            <p>
                For the theoretical portion, I think I could have engaged with the content a lot better. I knew the direction that I wanted to take some of the pieces, but they seemed to fall kind of short of having much depth or engaging with the content to the extent that I would have liked. I think I’d like to come back to them and refine them and do a little more research especially on the Internet artwork analysis. I enjoyed the rabbit hole into cyberfeminism that it led me through, and it is something I think I would like to explore that a little more. I think I was also struggling with trying to analyse the artwork using a framework because I wasn’t sure what to use or how to approach it. I was also struggling with trying to find information that would make sense in the context of analysing the work but also kept tripping up on the framework part and I think it affected the quality of the work a lot. The analysis piece was not well done and could use a lot of re-working.

                I decided to combine the creative practice portion and the artistic reflection because they’re closely related. Through the process of making the website and then writing the pieces and reading a little more into those topics the vision for what I wanted for my website changed a little and I think it became a little clearer to me in terms of what kind of aesthetic i want to try and use for the website. I’m still on the fence about leaning all the way into that computer or desktop aesthetic or trying to conceptualise it and create something that is like a desktop but not entirely. As I mention in the creative practice section, a potential idea for my artwork is a kind of game that kind of looks at feelings of burnout, intrusive thoughts, imposter syndrome and things like that. I have a twine game like this that I made earlier in the year but I wasn’t too sure how to integrate that into the website, so I did include the zip file with the submission in case.

                Overall, at the end of the assignment, the three sections didn’t feel complete despite me not having anything further to say or not wanting to add anything further. I think this can be largely attributed to the planning and the thought process behind the website and the artwork not being fleshed out too much and just approaching it from a few small ideas. I think I can say that by the end of it, I have a slightly clearer vision for the website although there are still some things like the details of the artwork and how it can be tied in with React, that still need to be refined. I think despite me feeling like something is missing, I’ve managed to get my website to what I would call the first draft. In terms of my goals for the website at this stage and the exploration of aesthetics and topics, I think that I’ve done that well enough here.
