                The exam, much like the last assignment did not go in the way that I had hoped it would. I think it’s fair to say that it was largely my fault. I kind of caved under the pressure between this exam and our DAP project and the amount of work that needed to be done and the very tiny window that we had to do all of it. It sounds a lot like an excuse but that’s what happened. I think I’m still proud of the work that I managed to do, even though it lacks some things and the use of certain things like libraries and a more finely tune skill set to make it really come to life, I think I’ve done good work here. I’m proud of what I’ve created and the way that it turned out in the end.

                The final blog post that I thought be relevant to add was to provide context on Vaporwave as an aesthetic and a movement and what it now represents and how it functions, I suppose, in our current society as a dead but not gone branch of media. I knew that in order to have the website be tied together and to have it be cohesive, I would need something that would provide more context to what I was trying to achieve. I knew that I needed to explore or at least explain why certain things, like a vaporwave aesthetic were chosen because it made little sense without it. The goal for the website was to be something like a POV for how we’ve experienced the last two years, primarily through a computer screen and how the constant online presence and the constant engagement with content that extends so bar beyond our bubbles and our country can then shape the way we view ourselves and how we fit in the big wide world.

                The use of Haraway’s Cyborg Manifesto and its cleverly structured dismantling of commonly understood identities in a Western, capitalist society and the use of the vaporwave aesthetic and its strong connections to nostalgia and warped chaotic views of time and it being a product of internet culture was done to emphasise the point I was trying to make.

                Using my own experiences throughout the last two years and what becoming an involuntary hermit has done to my perception of myself and how it too has become something of a blend of warped nostalgia trapped in the vague suggestion of a person and what it would mean now to reconstruct my identity and how I am perceived by others and myself.

                Technically speaking I think that there was a huge gap in terms of what was required. I stumbled again with React and the time that I had and did not have meant that I was running the risk submitting subpar work that would not communicate any of my artistic or creative goals but would also not be a good use of React. Leaving out React, as much as it could still hinder my marks, felt like the absolute best course of action. I knew what I wanted to prioritise and what I wanted to shine the most and unfortunately the technical portion of my exam did suffer because of it.

                My approach the artwork slightly changed. From the feedback, I think I started to understand that it wasn’t just the game that was the artwork but the entire website. Thinking of it in that sense was a great help because it made me realise that the game doesn’t have to be long and complicated and that I don’t have to pack so much nuance into it because it just forms a sliver of the artwork. I wanted the game to kind of feel like a back and forth between myself, where the player essentially takes the role of the voice in your head and the not so friendly things that it can say.

                I think I could have planned out the writing a lot better. I think it fell a little flat and it was rushed towards the end so it wasn’t really communicating what I wanted. I was considering taking the whole thing out because I wasn’t sure about how it would really function or tie in with the themes of the website but I did keep it in the end. I kept it purely because it felt like it was important in terms of exploring identity and the relationship between you and yourself and how you perceive yourself in a way. The intention is kind of emphasising the distance placed between you and your mind to the point where you treat your mind as another entity that has absolute control over you or at least has far greater influence over you than you do. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I do wish I had written better I think the themes could come across a lot more impactful especially if there was use of images and sounds and effects and the like. I think that those extra little things would have elevated it somewhat.
