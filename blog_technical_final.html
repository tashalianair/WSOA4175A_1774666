                I think largely the fear that I had for the most part when it came to the technical portion especially when using React was that the artwork was the entire website and the way it looked and the way it was experienced. I was able to achieve that well enough without React and trying to then rework the website using React was a struggle because there were many times when I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to do something because it would compromise the most important parts of the website. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It was a very special kind of sadness to work on something and not be able to show it. While working on implementing React I ran into too many roadblocks and given the fact that I wasn’t left with a lot time to find a remedy for a lot of the things that were broken, I had to not use it for fear that I would not have a working website to submit at the end of this and that, to me, is largely more important. I know React was meant to be easier to use and implement but I struggled enormously with it and trying to understand how things might work. Looking at it theoretically, it sounds like a dream. The creation of components and pages and essentially just plugging them into a single page and having them all work together, sounds like the easiest approach to web design and development but that really wasn’t the case for as long as we’ve been working on this website. I think I did put myself at a disadvantage by not using it from the start. My first assignment definitely should have the stumbling block to use to learn more about React because it was the assignment that was worth the least. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I do regret not being more confident in my ability to figure it out from the start and although I was figuring it out for the exam, I think the timing and the way that I handled this and the submission for my other big project was not done in the best way, and it impacted everything. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My fear regarding not being able to replicate the work that I had already done and in turn compromising the most important aspect of my website did come to light and I unfortunately had to make that decision of do I push through and risk the important parts of the website or do I want to submit a barely functioning website that doesn’t capture anything that you’re trying to communicate.
