                <h1>üåø<i>Decolonzing Knowledge and the Questions of the Arc</i> by Achille Mbembe (2015)üåø</h1>
                <p>
                    In the paper by Achille Mbembe, it is made apparent that the concept of decolonising technology does not start and end with technology. The roots and mutations of colonisation exist in the modern age and still permeate society at every level and that in order to decolonise technology, there are other branches of society that must also be put through the process of decolonisation. Nothing exists in isolation, everything enforces and influences the other. In the Water Mignolo and Catherine Walsh excerpt, they mention that coloniality and modernity are two incredibly intertwined concepts and can be referred to in tandem. Both Mbembe and Mignolo and Walsh express the idea that a starting point in the process of decolonisation is the dismantling and the interruption of the concept of modernity and how that is inextricably linked to colonisation. Mignolo and Walsh refer to modernity as the logic that steers colonisation. Historically, acts of colonisation were done under the pretence of civilising those who were colonised and bringing them into the modern age. Similar threads of pushing minorities to the fringes of society in the name of modernity or framing it as a sacrifice that must be paid for progress. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similar to Mignolo and Walsh‚Äôs concept of dismantling concepts of modernity, Mbembe expresses the idea that decolonisation especially in terms of education and technology should start in the environments that learning takes place. The architecture of buildings and the names of places and the ways in which we refer to things must be reframed so that the West is not the centre of these things. Being surrounded by the cultural and societal and environmental influences of colonisation enforces the concept that to be within the modern age and to be a modern community is to be centred around western concepts, traditions and practices. The reframing of these things can work as a first step towards practising decolonisation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mbmebe does mention that decolonisation is a far more nuanced and complicated process than politicians and academics would have it seem. Most post-colonial societies in today‚Äôs day and age still bear the deep-rooted mark of colonisation and while they might not be actively occupied lands or considered territories of other countries, they can still be considered colonised. Many post-colonial countries have deep systemic problems that continue to push marginalised people to the fringes of society. And without reforming these systems at all levels, there is no way to combat the issues that they continue to enforce. Issues of poverty, poor healthcare, education, protection and security, are further heightened by the traces of colonial practices left behind
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Mbembe article, there is mention of decolonisation being a process of re-centring and the active process of removing the West and Western practices, ideologies, systems and so on, from the centre of these post-colonised countries and places. Mbembe states it is ‚Äúabout rejecting the assumption that the modern West is the central root of Africa‚Äôs consciousness and cultural heritage.‚Äù, arguably the most important line being what follows that quote, ‚ÄúIt is about rejecting the notion that Africa is merely an extension of the West.‚Äù (Mbembe,2015, pg.16). Mbembe refers to another author, Ngugi wa Thiong‚Äôo, and their work on the reframing of Africa in a post-colonial world and how to go about decolonisation or Africanisation. Ngugi and Mbembe make the point of stating that the decolonisation of African educational institutions like universities and schools begin with the re-centring of African people, ideologies, histories, cultures, languages and so on. The beginning of this process of decolonisation begins with the exploration of and the understanding of oneself and the places that they are from. Ngugi and Mbembe do not make mention of outright rejecting Western practices and information and knowledge but place heavy emphasis on rejecting the West as the standard to which we hold ourselves and the shining pinnacle of modernity and progress.

                <p>
                    The concept of decolonisation in various fields and spaces is a tricky and slippery slope to navigate. The impacts of colonialism on the people and communities who were at its mercy can never be undone, none of us can go back and retrieve lost information and knowledge or untangle ourselves from colonial ideologies and practices. The reach that these ways of thinking have is pervasive and extends to so many layers of our lives that trying to begin to remove it from one place could cause other factions of society to crumble. I think the approach that Mbembe emphasises a lot throughout the reading in terms of rejecting the dominance of the West and the global North in terms of how knowledge is produced and what gets to count as knowledge but not casting them out completely is a good place to start. It allows for post-colonial countries and continents to begin to untangle themselves from the traces of colonialism and allow those communities to frame their education around themselves while still embracing and learning from others.
