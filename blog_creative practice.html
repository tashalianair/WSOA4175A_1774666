                <h1>ðŸŒ¿DescriptionðŸŒ¿</h1>
                <p>
                    My idea for the creative or the artwork aspect of the website is to reflect the current state of mind shared by a lot of other students that Iâ€™ve spoken 
                    to (mostly friends or peers). I want to kind of emulate the reality of us never really being able to escape being logged on. Always on a device (mostly our laptops), 
                    always on the internet and especially now through distanced learning and us being in our final year, the constant bombardment of work and responsibilities and 
                    thoughts as well as the overwhelming nature of things like social media and the bombardment of news and information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Last semester I made a game in twine for an assignment that tackles the sorts of feelings around Imposter Syndrome and intrusive thoughts and I think that I want to use 
                    like that as the base for this idea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My idea is to have the website look like the desktop of a computer and have there be different application shortcuts on the screen that works as the navigation. 
                    I have done a little bit of reference research and have seen people completely recreate the Mac desktop in website format. I donâ€™t think I want that, I think Iâ€™m 
                    aiming for a more stylised version but still retains some of the functionality of a desktop. The artwork aspect comes in through the use of pop-up windows and 
                    applications like a replica of a browser that is just a constant stream of news that you canâ€™t interact with or something.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the end of the process of working on the website, I think my style/aesthetic for the website as a whole is going to change. I want it to incorporate a vaporwave 
                    aesthetic because I think this kind of aesthetic links to my idea for my artwork and it works well with the ways in which my concepts of art and the internet are 
                    changing. It also works well with the things I want to try and communicate with my artwork, that feeling that with all the time weâ€™re spending online (both on the 
                    internet and on our devices) our concepts of reality, technology and identities are being blurred and mixed in a giant melting pot.

                <h1>ðŸŒ¿Reflection on Links to TheoreticalðŸŒ¿</h1>
                <p>
                    Initially, I couldnâ€™t really identify the links and the connections between what I was reading and the theory and what I was trying to make. After trying to do more 
                    research for the art analysis, I was reintroduced to the Cyborg Manifesto by Donna Haraway and the concepts around cyberfeminism and while what I want to do isnâ€™t 
                    exactly in line with those concepts and those theories, they are beginning to be influenced and informed by them and I want to continue to build on those themes and 
                    concepts the further we go and hopefully make stronger connections between the things that I would like to communicate as well as the things that I am taking interest in.

                <p>
                    There are some websites that I found that have inspired the format that I'm trying to create:
                </p>
                <p>Dreya Antonelli's <a href="https://deryasdesktop.com/#"><i>An Ordinary Portfolio Page of Dreya</i></a></p>
                <p><a href="http://eeerik.com/">Erik Bernacchi</a></p>
                <p><a href="https://simone.computer/#/">Simone's computer</a></p>
                <p>Images for the icons were taken from the photoshoot for the album <i>Wasteland, Baby!</i> by Hozier, taken by Raine Hozier-Byrne</p>
                <br>
                <h1>ðŸŒ¿Technical Concerns and ChallengesðŸŒ¿</h1>
                <p>
                    Recreating or creating some kind of desktop dupe is definitely something that I think will be challenging. Even on its own is something a little daunting to attempt, 
                    but with the added terror of using React, I think that is a challenge all its own. I also think that trying to construct the creative component would be challenging 
                    because I donâ€™t know how to structure or present it just yet for starters.
