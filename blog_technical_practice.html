                <p>
                    Assignment one, in terms of the technical portion, has no React elements. For the most part, I’m using this first assignment or this first iteration as a way to sketch out my idea for what I want the website to look like and also as a way to gauge the scope of what I would need to then do in React going forward. I would also like to improve the feel of the website as well, or at least try to work towards making the association between the website and a desktop more similar. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The website itself isn’t technically impressive in the sense that it doesn’t have a lot going on yet. The creative aspect of it is still to be attempted or completed and for the most part, a majority of the work has been trying to style the page and attempt to create a similar feeling as when using a computer. For this point, I wasn’t entirely sure of what kind of javascript components I should include yet aside from the work that I’ll be doing with React for the second assignment. Because of this, there isn’t a whole lot of javascript, aside from the attempt made to create a draggable window pane. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Going forward and working towards the next assignment, there is a lot that I can improve on before even beginning to implement React. Implementing little things like meta tags and making sure that the website is responsive are things that need to be done better for the next assignment. I’m not entirely sure how to make the website responsive or at least maintain consistency (in terms of scaling and presentation) on a multitude of devices but it is something I will be working towards. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This goes hand in hand with my intention of working on the readability and also aspects of accessibility for the website. I understand that there are some aspects of it that are not the most well-designed but it is a goal of mine for the next assignment to hopefully have the website be more user-friendly for a wider pool of users. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In terms of the functionality of the navigation bar, I am planning on making drop down menus to try and create that same sort of feeling as when you right-click on icons on a window's start bar. I have not done that for this assignment. The creative tab on the navigation bar will lead you to the art work  and the home tab will take you back to the homepage. The icon next to the 'Wasteland' title will also be a drop-down menu that will have everything in the same way that the windows icon shows you all of your applications.
