                On the surface and possibly even after engaging with the game that was intended to be the artwork, the connection between it and the website might not be crystal clear. I think after receiving feedback from the last assignment and even after doing more reading into the Cyborg Manifesto and looking in Vaporwave as an aesthetic and as a cultural movement, I decided to frame my approach slightly different.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The website as a whole functions as something of an artwork and as a representation of my mind and my experiences. The game, which was meant to function as an artwork on its own, was meant to be an exploration of a particular feeling that has only grown over the last two years and that was something that I wanted to share and explore further. Looking at the way that I designed and structured the website and the aesthetic that I decided to go with it became clearer to me that everything together made for a more interesting experience than just the game on its own. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking at the website from the perspective of what has been our lives, especially as digital art students and even more so as women on the internet and in the space, the website as a whole functions as a means of expressing or representing a small, splinter of the larger experience. The chaotically jumbled identity that emerged at the end of these last two years and the small moments that contributed to it and the lens through which life was experienced for many of us in these last two years. Viewing the world through a screen and having that be the only interaction most of us had with each other and that being the biggest influence on the way that you begin to perceive yourself and begin to view how you fit together and how you fit within a society. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For the game I put it a loop to kind of signify the cyclical nature of my thoughts or at least those thoughts and how they never entirely leave you. I’m not sure if it was the best idea, I don’t think it has enough impact but I’m not entirely sure what could make that better. Better writing maybe and having something like effects or music or some kind of sound effect.
