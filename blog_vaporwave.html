                Vaporwave is very much considered a child of the internet. It is described in an article titled Vaporwave is Dead, Long Live Vaporwave written by Emily Gosling as having visuals that were “ghostly, neon-lit dreamscapes of childhood nostalgia: metallic but sweet, like fortified breakfast cereals packaged in saccharine colors and MS Paint aesthetics” (Gosling, 2020). Although now it is more commonly associated with its visuals, vaporwave started out as a branch of the electronic music genre which took inspirations from dance music mostly associated with the 80s and 90s that were then warped and twisted and reassembled through the use of chopped and screwed techniques, repetition and heavy reverb.

            <p>
                Emily Gosling explains how both in terms of the music and the visuals, vaporwave relies on “looping and fetishizing familiar trash culture motifs (infomercials, retro video games, ‘80s and ‘90s TV, old-school Word Art) and rendering them queasily unsettling” (Gosling, 2020). The backbone of vaporwave is its strong connection to the past or more specifically nostalgia and reworking it to appear as something new. Vaporwave, in my opinion is something of the perfect visual and sonic representation of what nostalgia is. A Frankenstein assemblage of things from times past that have been warped and skewed and changed into something that is both known and unknown to you.

                In his book Babbling Corpse: Vaporwave and the Commodification of Ghosts, Grafton Tanner explains that “vaporwave is the musical product of a culture plagued by trauma and regression of late capitalism” (Tanner, pg 10, 2016) and that with the “unprecedented access to the Internet, the flattened desert where past, present, and future comingle, we find ourselves living in a state of atemporality, yearning for a time before the present.” (Tanner, pg 10, 2016). Tanner’s view on vaporwave are an indication of how it emphasises the relationship between art and capitalism. Tanner also says that “vaporwave is the music of ‘non-times’ and ‘non-places’ because it is skeptical of what consumer culture has done to time and space,”. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Gosling describes vaporwave as a satirical exploration on terribleness and that through the use of terrible visuals and music, vaporwave is allowing and encourage people to become more aware of the kinds of space we engage in, “by consuming it, we’re accepting the foibles and awfulness of capitalism, bad graphic design, war, technology, heck even ourselves. And we’re in on the joke.” (Gosling, 2020

            <p>
                Vaporwave has lasted for as long as it has because these views and takes on it are still an ever present mark on our present times. Gosling states that the reasons behind why vaporwave is still relevant have to do with the fact that “it’s one of the few aesthetics that so succinctly sums up the rapid and terrifying pace of change we face today. Change, especially with such rapaciousness, is frightening:  vaporwave’s sonic and aesthetic amalgamation of nostalgia and the utopian/dystopian future summed up this fear perfectly.”. Vaporwave has merged from nostalgic reconstruction so of music to a way to critique the way the world is unfolding and in many ways falling apart under the systems and practices that governments and societies around the world use. It dabbles in the idea of pointing out the terrible things through the use of relics of the past and showing us all how as silly as some of these things might have been now, look, in comparison, how much more terrible things have become.
