                <h1>Internet Art Analysis: My Boyfriend Came Back from the War by Olia Lialina (1996)</h1>
                <p>
                    My Boyfriend Came Back from the War by Olia Lialina is a “browser-based hyperlinked ‘netfilm’ (to use [Olia Liallina] preferred term)” that 
                    tells the story of a man who returns home from an unspecified conflict and the cracks in the relationship with his girlfriend that ensues after 
                    his return. The netfilm “moves away from the more technical considerations of net art to concentrate on narrative (however disjointed) and 
                    emotion”, through the use of the grainy black and white images and GIFs and the split frames that interacting with the hyperlinks and the 
                    images creates. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The narrative of the game follows a couple who have been apart due to some unexplained or mentioned war or conflict. Her boyfriend has 
                    returned home from the war, and they now face turbulence and trouble in their relationship. The narrative itself is non-linear and feels 
                    fractured and disjointed. In some ways it creates the imagery of their relationship being a mirror or a window that has been shattered 
                    and the way that you as the player or viewer see it is through the shards of it. Clicking a hyperlink, an image or a GIF splits the 
                    page into a section and interacting with them again or with something else creates another split and it continues like that, each split 
                    leading to a different interaction between the couple or two sides of the same conversation. When that particular frame’s interactions 
                    are complete the square turns black. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In an article on Olia Lialina’s piece, draw comparisons between the frames that are created and split in the artwork to windows and how 
                    that is linked to the concept of voyeurism and the nature of voyeurism is film. In My Boyfriend Came Back from the War, this window symbolism 
                    places the viewer in the position of the voyeur, as someone who is looking in on the collapse of this relationship. Another point that the 
                    writer of the article makes is that the nature of a film and the way that it is consumed compared to a website or things on a computer are 
                    (or at least were at the time this artwork was created) opposites of a sort. Films are a very passive media, in the sense that viewers cannot 
                    interact with the film in anyway, they are simply meant to watch as things unfold and as the story progresses. Computer users are meant to act 
                    and interact and engage with systems and things that are on computers. Positioning My Boyfriend Came Back from the War as both filmlike and as 
                    something that you are meant to engage with and interact reinforces that sad and inevitable nature of the couples’ story and how you choose 
                    whatever route you want or try to interact with as many frames in as many ways as possible, but you cannot change the outcome of their 
                    relationship. You cannot prevent the deterioration of their relationship because the damage has already been done. You have entered their 
                    story while it was well passed the halfway mark and can only now look on as their trauma and mistakes lead them to ruin. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The article also mentions that the ways in which hyperlinks are used in the artwork, and the fragmented nature of the way that the story 
                    unfolds can be representative of the way that memories are experienced. We mostly remember moments in bits and pieces, not always recalling 
                    the contexts that make up that moment or the reasons why they happened in perfect clarity, but always recalling vague or fractured pieces of 
                    them. It also speaks to the subjectivity of how things are remembered and experienced. This relates back to the voyeuristic nature of the 
                    game as well as the way that the story unfolds and suddenly things that transpire in the game start to become clearer. You can start to see 
                    the reasoning behind the actions of the couple. Home for him was an untainted and fond memory, a place where he would be safe and happy but 
                    home for her could have become lonely and scary if they were a country at war. Memories and realities colliding and making for messy ends, 
                    all communicated in a simple but strikingly effective way.
