                <h1>A close reading of The Cyborg Manifesto, by Donna Haraway</h1>
                <p>
                    Donna Haraway’s The Cyborg Manifesto is a long and detailed essay, expanding on and explaining matters relating to what it 
                    means to be a person in the ever-advancing technological world that we do and how matters of technological progression, 
                    essentialism, the patriarchy and matters of feminism and gender are all interlinked and connected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the advancement of technology and the integration of into the lives of almost every single person on the planet makes 
                    the declaration that we are all cyborgs make more sense than you would think. Haraway explains that the concept of a person 
                    being a cyborg, as a hybrid creature comprised of nature and machine, is not to be taken in the most literal sense for the 
                    most part. It’s not so much to do with having machinery and microchips installed under your skin and replacing parts of your 
                    natural body with machinery. Haraway explains that it has more to do with the ways in which humans have attained or developed 
                    features that could not have been developed on their own. Think of the ways that people have been able to extend their life 
                    expectancies or the creation of things though technology to help better our lives. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are also cyborgs in the sense of the impact that we have on technology and the impact that it has on us through the 
                    shaping of communities, cultures, identities, and other things that occur in the social spheres of our lives. Technology 
                    in all its forms are a far cry from being completely neutral. Any kind of technology is always tainted by the thoughts, 
                    feelings, and beliefs of those who make them and those who own them. They are always shaped by the conscious or subconscious 
                    bias of those who have a hand in its creation and those biases influence the ways in which people develop and shape their 
                    own identities both as an individual and as a member of a community. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    An interest that I have in Haraway’s concept of the cyborg is the role that it plays gender and feminism. Cyborg, as 
                    Haraway explains it, exists in the space between organism and machine and because of that, merges and blurs the lines 
                    between nature and culture and in turn removing the validity from essentialist justifications or explanations of human 
                    culture. By deconstructing or redefining what is seen as natural and what is unnatural, there is the opportunity for 
                    people, in this case women, to be seen outside of the realm of what is “natural” for them. It removes women from the 
                    construct and understand of what a woman is and what they can or cannot do. Without placing value or purpose by the 
                    natural things that they can do, women are fit to redefine the ways in which they are seen and heard. Apart from women, 
                    the concept of the cyborg and dismantling essentialist practices and theories and basis of thought allows for other 
                    marginalised people to redefine how they are seen. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a way, the concept of the cyborg allows us to dismantle societal constructs, in terms of identity, to be looked at 
                    through a different lens or not at all. I think it was something that I thought about while reading, that while the 
                    cyborg would have little use for labels like race and culture and so on, to BIPOC, those labels are very important. 
                    They are ways for people to make sense of who they are, for them to be able to have links and connections to who 
                    they could have been, who they still could be. In some ways they are also important for navigating the world that 
                    we currently live in. To know how people perceive you, how they will use you and your culture and what they have the 
                    power to do to you. Haraway’s cyborg does not deny these labels as being part of the person but that they should not 
                    be naturalised and used as a way to generalise and stereotype and find a way to justify those stereotypes and otherwise 
                    oppressive behaviours by saying things like “it’s just in your nature”
