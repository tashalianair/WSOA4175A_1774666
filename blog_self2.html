                I think that it's safe to say that this assignment did not go as well as I would have liked.
There were many things that I. wanted to do but didn't get to implement for a number of
reasons and those reasons don't necessarily change the outcome of the situation. I was a
little frustrated with myself for this assignment largely because I did not know or feel like I
knew where to start or what to do because of how overwhelming it is.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the theoretical portion of the assignment I am left feeling the same I do at the end of
every IM submission and that is like I could have done better and I could have pushed the
concepts I was working on a lot harder. I stumbled quite a bit with the Donna Haraway "A
Cyborg Manifesto" essay because it's a really dense piece of writing and I had to try and
read through it more than once two get some idea of what she was saying and it worked and
I really enjoyed it but it didn't leave me with a lot of time to formulate a blog post in a way that
I would like. It felt very surface-level and like it didn't do as good of a job as I would have
liked. I also released that I didn't have a space for my references and will definitely be adding
them in before the exam.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the close reading, I tried to focus on a portion of the essay and work through it that way
but I don't think I did enough to really do a deep dive into the points that Haraway was
making and I think that also has to do with my not completely understanding the way she
was explaining it either. I think in that respect, although it felt surface-level I think I did
manage to come out of it with a decent piece.
            </p>
            <p>
                The blog post was, I think, a little too short and I know that we’re not meant to go back and
rework our theory pieces but I would like to come back to this and do it better because I think
it’s a really important piece for my project. I also want to do a blog post on the vaporwave
aesthetic because there’s a lot of history and context that I think through exploring and
writing about, I can then apply to my project.
            </p>

                For the art analysis, I chose Olia Lialina's artwork from 1996 because it was an interesting
way of exploring the communication and presentation of narrative in a way that feels almost
like a game but utilises a different field of art principles to make it. I chose it because I felt
like it linked to the kind of thing I want to communicate with my art piece. Not in the sense of
a similar story but in the way that it portrays an experience and brings the user as close as
possible to what is happening but acknowledging that the user is very much removed from
the experience in the sense that it is not theirs. It also was really interesting to see how she
conveyed a very subjective experience to the user or the player and the ways in which she
did that.
            </p>
            <p>
                For my blog post, I wanted to look at it through this lens, through what I took out of the
experience of interacting and engaging with the artwork and the things that stood out the
most to me and although I do feel it was a little short and the I don't think I explained it
enough detail I was pleased with the result of that.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the technical aspects of the assignment, I think it's fair to say that I struggled with it quite
a bit. I struggled with using React and putting it together and trying to understand it outside
of the class activities that we had. I think a lot of the issues I had could have been solved if I
was not so overwhelmed by React and the libraries and thinking of all of the things that I had
to do and the other pressures that were outside of doing the actual assignment like load
shedding and not having access to the Internet and trying to complete other projects for
other courses.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another thing that I realised in hindsight was that I was more concerned with having all of the
necessary elements on the website than making sure that they worked well and that they
were responsive and that they were functional. Present me has left future me with a lot of
mistakes to comb through and solve and it's not terrible but I think that it's going to cause me
a bit of trouble later on when I do have to either build the website as a React app on its own,
from scratch or figure out how to add React components to my already existing website.
I did also completely forget about the smaller details I was meant to fix like the
responsiveness and the meta tags for the website. For the responsiveness, I think a lot of
the struggle would come from not knowing how to do it without compromising the concept of
the website.
            </p>
            <p>
                The prototype was also something that I wanted to be done better. I struggled a lot with it
because while the logic behind it and the steps that I would need to make something like a
text-based adventure game seemed simple and very obvious to me, it took me a very long
time to understand what to do and how to do it and also what I really needed and what I
didn't. I don't have any React for the prototype which means that I did not meet the
requirement for that section but I did want to have something to show how I wanted the
artwork to feel. The version I have is very simplified and not like the file I submitted last time
but I have reworked it the way I want it to be this time. Hopefully, the direction that I take with
the game can hopefully connect more with the aesthetic and some of the theoretical work
that I've looked at.
