                I think at the end of this I finally kind of fit all the puzzle pieces of this project together. Between the theory and the creative practice and the artwork, I really think it all came together well in the end. Looking at vaporwave more in-depth and understanding what it is rather than just what it looks like really helped cement the kind of artwork that I wanted to create and the kind of themes I wanted to represent with it

                That quote from the vaporwave blog post about how vaporwave is “the musical product of a culture plagued by trauma and regression in late capitalism” and using that in connection with the idea and the concept of broken identities and how in the last two years, we are all just made of the memories of a time when things were not so completely wrecked. Facing the knowledge that we can never go back to how it was but cannot see a future where anything is better and constantly throwing ourselves into the past, idealising it and warping it into a kind of bittersweet nostalgia because looking back is better than trying to look forward to a future that does not look brighter.

                I didn’t want to change anything visually from the last assignment apart from maybe trying to improve the way that the UI looked and maybe try to get it to look similar to a Windows95 aesthetic but I decided to scrap that and keep it the way it was. I’m still quite happy with the way it looks and the way it functions. I still think in terms of responsiveness there is some work to be done but I am still unsure of how to go about that without compromising the effect of the website or how it reads. On too small a screen I don’t think it would read as a desktop and I don’t think it would have the same kind of impact if it were to look different. I think there’s probably some work to be done in terms of looking at bridging the gap that I have created between art and accessibility and how those two function together and ultimately the consequences of prioritising the artwork over it being accessible.
