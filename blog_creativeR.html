            <p>
                Something I think I need to do a bit more research on is the vaporwave aesthetic especially in terms of its application and its history. For this 
                assignment I didn’t really dive too deep into it and went purely based on surface level observations on what it is and how it works. It might be 
                something interesting to maybe write as a blog post for the exam (if that is one of the requirements) and explore it in terms of its aesthetic 
                and the impact that its had on digital culture. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Something I mentioned in my technical reflection was my intention to make use of a React library that has UI elements that resemble that of Windows95. 
                I didn’t manage to use it for this assignment for a number of reasons ranging from not fully understanding how, getting stuck too many times and 
                not being able to do it or figure it out rather within the time I had to do the assignment (which is to say the time that I left myself with and 
                not the time between assignments). I do think it would be something that would not only help with the overall visuals of the website and tie in 
                well with the kind of imagery I’m trying to evoke but might also help clear up a lot of the technical issues that I have with regards to UI and 
                responsiveness. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Something else I think is worth mentioning is that while the images that I used for this assingment were not mine (frantically chosen from Google Images,
                unfortunately) I do want to make some icons and art of my own for the website just to give it a more personalized touch. Especially for the blog icons 
                and the "wallpaper" for the website as well as the art that will be used for the game. Thankfully the game isn't going to be too long so there won't be 
                a lot of images.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the prototype of the artwork, the text that is seen is not what the final will be. I need to do a lot more writing and research and shaping 
                of the concept and idea before actually building the artwork and this prototype is just a way for me to test the waters, so to speak, on how to 
                go about building the game. I think an important point for me to remember is to make sure that what I am planning and what I want from this 
                artwork is something that aligns with what I can do both in terms of skill and time. I know the vague outline of the kind of narrative I want to 
                set up and the kind of experience that I want to communicate with the game but I think that I also need to be mindful of the just how much work 
                and how much time that it will take to get that vision across and also present it in a way that doesn’t confuse or agitate or frustrate the player 
                in ways that I don’t want. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Trying to find a balance in the pacing of the narrative and the structure of it and the way that I’m positioning the character is vital to the 
                game. I think it’s also important for me to think about whether I want the artwork to be a reflection of my own experience or try to make it 
                something that the player or the user can place themselves in and can feel like it’s being told from their perspective.
